Calculator Project for The Odin Project
Got to use both HTML/CSS as well as JavaScript DOM manipulation techniques to create an in browser calculator app. 
I drew some inspiration from the iPhone calculator style. 
During the desing process I came across many bugs and consequently had to debug the most out of my projects so far. 
The code could be cleaner, moving forward I will try and emphasize stubbing before I begin a project to better aid in code organization and readability.
